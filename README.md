Journey's YouTube Video Blocker - YouTube Video Blocker fork for Chrome and Chrome-like things

## Notice!

As of 09/04/17 This extension will be deprecated until further notice. I don't have time to work on this project any and I don't know when I will have time. I am disabling issues until further notice along with this decision. Please do not comment on commits or anything about this project not working as I already know it's not working.

If in need of an extension that works on the newest youtube design until I can get around to updating this, you can take a look at this [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keyword-blocker/pbgacppomjfpheddhifkdkklddnolnpg) it does everything that Video Blocker does plus a bit more, and it works on the latest youtube design. 

## Releases

At the Current time there are no releases scheduled for chrome store. Sorry

## What is this

Journey's YouTube Video Blocker is an extension that is based off of [Video Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-blocker/jknkjnpcbbgcbdbaampbjlhkcghmgfhk?hl=en) to get things working again as the extension stopped working on 4/20/17 and the developer had disappeared off the face of the planet. My plans are to keep this extension alive and working for as long as possible.

## what Does it do

Journey's YouTube Video Blocker allows you to hide videos from channels that you don't like. You can specify these channels by right-clicking on a link to a video on YouTube or by adding them manually via the options page. You can also hide videos from multiple channels at once, by using a wildcard or adding regular expressions. Blocking videos with certain keywords in their title is also possible! For more information on how to do this exactly, please visit the help section at the settings after installing this extension. Every item you add to your block-list can now also be protected with a password!
